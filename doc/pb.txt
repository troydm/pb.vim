This is a simple vim plugin for interacting with Mac OS X pastebuffer
using pbcopy and pbpaste utilities. It provides two commands for yanking text
into pastebuffer and pasting text from Mac OS X pastebuffer
Pbyank and Pbpaste that operate on {range} and can take {register} as first argument

g:pb_command_prefix     (Default: '')
    You can define optional global option for prepanding to pbpaste and pbcopy command
