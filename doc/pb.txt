 1. INTRODUCTION                                                  *pb.vim-intro*

This is a simple vim plugin for interacting with Mac OS X pastebuffer
using pbcopy and pbpaste utilities. It provides two commands for yanking text
into pastebuffer and pasting text from Mac OS X pastebuffer
Pbyank and Pbpaste that operate on {range} and can take {register} as first 
argument. They also support text selected in |visual-mode| area

==============================================================================
 2. CONFIGURATION                                         *pb.vim-configuration*

                                                         *g:pb_command_prefix*
g:pb_command_prefix     (Default: '')
    You can define optional global option for prepanding to pbpaste and pbcopy 
    command. For example if you want to use Mac OS X pastebuffer on remote host
    let g:pb_command_prefix = 'ssh remotehost '

 2. USAGE                                                         *pb.vim-usage*

                                                          *Pbyank*
:[range]Pbyank [x]
    To yank text into Mac OS X pastebuffer from {range}
    If {range} is empty current line is used
    If in |visual-mode| yanks only currently selected text in |visual-mode| area 
    If register name is provided yanks text from register instead of range

                                                          *Pbpaste*
:[range]Pbpaste [x]
    To paste text from Mac OS X pastebuffer replacing {range}
    Replaced {range} is copied into "" register or [x] register name
    If |visual-mode| area is selected instead of {range} it replaces selected
    |visual-mode| area text with a text from Mac OS X buffer and yanks previously
    selected text into "" register or [x] register name 
    If no {range} is specified and no |visual-mode| area is selected it pastes 
    text at current cursor position. If only [x] register name is provided 
    it pastes text into register instead of current buffer

                                                          *PbPaste*
:[range]PbPaste [x]
    Same as |Pbpaste| but works just like |P|
